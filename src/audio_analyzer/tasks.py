                Analyze a sales call transcription between a customer and an agent.

                - Sales Opportunities: Highlight any opportunities for upselling or cross-selling.
                - Competitor Mentions: Note if the customer referred to competitors and what was mentioned.
                - Call Engagement: Analyze how engaged the customer was during the conversation (e.g., level of questions asked, responsiveness, and tone).
                - Recommendations: Offer tailored advice for the agent to improve their approach in future calls.
                - Actionable Insights: Provide clear next steps for both the agent and the customer, with assigned responsibilities and timelines.

                Structure your response as a JSON object with the following keys:
                - sentiment_analysis
                - key_phrases
                - customer_pain_points
                - agent_effectiveness_score
                - sales_opportunities
                - competitor_mentions
                - call_engagement
                - recommendations
                - actionable_insights

                If any key is not relevant or no information is found, explicitly state "No relevant information found" for that key.
                The JSON must be concise, structured, and professional.
